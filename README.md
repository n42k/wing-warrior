# Wing Warrior

A game I wrote in 48 hours for the 36th Ludum Dare.
Fight in a stadium to the death! Includes human-powered bombers! Requires skill. 
**IMPORTANT NOTE**: It's rather hard to play at first. You will miss content if you don't dedicate a good chunk of time. Sword fighting isn't the only content, there's flying too! 

## Controls

* Arrow keys to move. 
* Z to attack.
* X to fire an orb (you must have ammo)
* Space bar to jump
* More instructions can be found inside the game.

## Objectives

* Get 1000 points and don't die to win!
